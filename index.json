Most traffic jam can be alleviated if all traffic signals are dynamically adjusted and optimized at different location and time period. Following the idea, we designed and implemented a low-cost and real-time traffic signal system on NVIDIA Jetson TK1 using Fast-RCNN to detected the traffic flow and reinforcement learning to train the traffic signal switching interval model. Our system is effective on simple traffic simulation, and thus won the 2017 National Technology and Research Scholarship presented by CTCI Foundation.\nLink to the poster.\n","date":1541174400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1541174400,"objectID":"88b6f6a1e6e2864d503d6af52a547b2d","permalink":"https://Daikon-Sun.github.io/project/ctci/","publishdate":"2018-11-03T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/project/ctci/","section":"project","summary":"Artificial Intelligence Traffic Control System: A Deep Learning Approach to Solve Structural Traffic Jam Problem","tags":["ML and DL"],"title":"AI Traffic Control System [CTCI Scholarship]","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Our work includes two stages.

Perform structural hash to merge the structurally equivalent signals (i.e. replace a gate with its functionally equivalent one) by comparing their gate types and permuting their inputs.

LeCun et al. in 1989, who successfully trained a CNN for digit classification. However, not until 2012, when A.Krizhevsky et al. applied this architecture in ILSVRC-2012 competition and won the first place with top-5 error rates of 15.3% (which improves by more than 10% compared to previous feature engineering methods), did CNN take over computer vision. In recent years, the advance of GPU, the availability of much larger training sets, and better model regularization strategies all contribute to the dramatic improvement in performance. Nevertheless, on the outset, it was unclear what CNN actually learned and thus cast doubt on the model. In this project, we discuss and compare different methods of visualization on various well-known models, in order to gain further sights into the structure and success of CNN.\nVisualization Methods  Activity: Visualize the output of a neuron for a given image. Deconvolutional Network: Reconstruct the input image from a given neuron by unpooling, ReLu and deconvolution (transpose convolution). Saliency Map: Calculate the gradient of a score model for a class with respect to the input image. Deep Generator Network (DGN): Use a pretrained image generator instead of hand-crafted priors.
