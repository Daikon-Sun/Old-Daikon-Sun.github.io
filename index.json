Most traffic jam can be alleviated if all traffic signals are dynamically adjusted and optimized at different location and time period. Following the idea, we designed and implemented a low-cost and real-time traffic signal system on NVIDIA Jetson TK1 using Fast-RCNN to detected the traffic flow and reinforcement learning to train the traffic signal switching interval model.

For example, tools change the name \u0026ldquo;a[0]\u0026rdquo; into \u0026ldquo;a_0_\u0026rdquo; to follow the rule: “no special character”. Meanwhile, name mapping plays an important role in verification tools because good name mapping can help verification tools efficiently and correctly verify designs. Humans can easily tell the mapping rules/relations, but it is difficult for machines/tools to solve the mapping automatically.\nProblem Formulation In this contest, the problem formulation is program-building for name mapping. Contestants shall write a program that accepts a given set of mapping relations and generate a Python script. Then, the Python script can generate the same mapping result.

In recent years, the advance of GPU, the availability of much larger training sets, and better model regularization strategies all contribute to the dramatic improvement in performance. Nevertheless, on the outset, it was unclear what CNN actually learned and thus cast doubt on the model. In this project, we discuss and compare different methods of visualization on various well-known models, in order to gain further sights into the structure and success of CNN.\nVisualization Methods  Activity: Visualize the output of a neuron for a given image.
